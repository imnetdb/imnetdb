# IMNetDB

As a network automation engineer you may want to create applications that have a database backend that stores
the "source of truth" or "intent" of your network and services.  This repo contains a Python library that
uses the [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com/) database software to create such application-specific backed
databases.

While every application will ultimately be different, there are a common set of networking constructs to get started 
with.  These include the following:

*Basic Device*
   * **Device** - represents a single managed device
   * **DeviceGroup** - represents a group of devices
   * **Interface** - represents a device interface
   * **Cable** - represents the connection between two device interfaces

*Virtual Networking*   
   * **VLAN** - represents a VLAN
   * **VLANGroup** - represents a group of VLANs
   
*IP management*

   * **RoutingTable** - represents a routing-table
   * **IPAddress** - represents an IPv4 or IPv6 address
   * **IPNetwork** - represents an IPv4 or IPv6 network address
   * **IPInterface** - represents an IPv4 or IPv6 interface address

This library is meant to be a "low level" programming interface, but provide specific capabilities that are 
commonly needed for network management oriented applications.  For example, this library supports the ability
to "allocate unused interfaces" and manage "cable relationships between devices".  This library also contains 
constructs so that you, as a python develooper, can create your own new database nodes and edges and extend the use 
of this repo in a way that is specific to your application.
   
# Why ArangoDB

I chose AranagoDB after looking at a few other database systems.  There are many to choose from, and they each
have their own sets of pros & cons.  I selected ArangoDB for the following reasons:

  * Single database system that provide a Graph and NoSQL capabilities
  * Does not require pre-defining schemas, which lends itself well for organic changes
  * Community and Enterprise editions available
  * Docker image freely available
  * WebUI for human interaction and dev-testing 
  * Came highly recommended from a trusted colleague and network automation expert

# Before You Begin

Before using this repo you need to have the following installed on your system:

  * Python3.6
  * Docker
  
You must also have access to the Internet so that you can download the ArangoDB docker image.  
  
# Installation

This library is presently not installed in PyPi.  Therefore
you must clone and install into your environment for now.  

You should create a virtualenv and activate it before installing
this project.

````bash
$ python setup.py install
````

You will also need to have ArangoDB installed.  For convenience,
there is a [docker-compose](tests/docker-compose.yml) file located in the **tests** directory.  This
file contains the default login user password.  You can change the value in the docker-compose.yml file,
or use other ArangoDB methods to handle login user-passwords.

Presuming you have Docker installed on your system, and you have Internet access, you can
download the ArangoDB docker image and start the server using the following 
command:

```bash
$ (cd tests; docker-compose up -d)
```

At this point you should be able to open you webbrowser to the ArangoDB WebUI
page:

```bash
http://localhost:8529
```

# Usage

The first step is to connect to the database.  If the database does not exist, it will automatically be
created based on the defined nodes and edges defined in the [models.py](imnetdb/db/models.py) file.  You
can create different databases, each representing your specific network application.  If you do not provide
the `db_name` parameters, the default value is "imnetdb".

````python
from imnetdb.db import IMNetDB

client = IMNetDB(password='admin123', db_name='myappdb')
````

At this point you can then start using the client to manage the database.
For examples, you can review the files in the **tests** directory.

Here is a basic example to create a devices with interfaces:

````python
from bracket_expansion import bracket_expansion
from imnetdb.db import IMNetDB

client = IMNetDB(password='admin123')

leaf = client.devices.ensure('leaf1', role='leaf', description='this is my spine')

for if_name in bracket_expansion("Ethernet[1-48]"):
    client.interfaces.ensure((leaf, if_name), speed=10)

for if_name in bracket_expansion("Ethernet[49-56]"):
    client.interfaces.ensure((leaf, if_name), speed=100)
````

*NOTE: There is a companion project for device-templates that is used to fabricate devices and
interfaces that are specific to VENDOR and MODEL.  Refer to the [device-stencils](https://github.com/imnetdb/device-stencils)
project for more details*
# Interface Allocation

The `interfaces` attribute provides a method that allows you to allocate a number of unused
interfaces based on the criteria you provide.  By default all interfaces are added
to the NSOTDB with a field `used = False`.  For more information on this feature,
please refer to:

````python
help(client.interfaces.allocate)
````
